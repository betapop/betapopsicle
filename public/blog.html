              happy birthday to me :) i am now concerningly close to a certain
              age i am not mentally ready for! huzzah!
            </p>
            <p>
              on a more serious note, i genuinely cant tell if life has been
              better or worse. i mean, generally i think this year was better
              then the hell that was 2024 but it isnt by a lot. especially with
              current world events and all that im just always stressed out and
              i really hate looking at the news and being force fed it every day
            </p>
            <p>
              like, i understand maturing and all that but i feel like newer
              generations wont even be able to be kids anymore. but maybe im
              just projecting lol
            </p>
            <p>
              anyways, less about current world events and more about me. (yay!)
              a lot of cool things have happened, and i feel like im improving a
              little! i really pray that these improvements stick this time
              because whats the point if i can never remember, haha
            </p>
            <p>
              AND big things have happened for the #tech nerds! i finally got an
              actual pc (like a real, shiny desktop one) anddd i also got a wii
              i havent modded yet! im planning to, but i misplaced the sd card i
              think unless i just forgot to buy it in the first place-- anyways.
              the new pc has been epic and awesome and i can play games now at
              good fps!! yippee!!
            </p>
            <p>
              and that leads into the next thing too, im actually working on a
              game jam rn! as in im updating this site to procastinate on
              writing and doing art for said jam sfkmdsmfok but its turning out
              really well methinks... i really hope i can be able to finish and
              publish it this time!
            </p>
            <p>
              other things.... im still going strong at my job and just recently
              got a raise! and its finally fall time so all of the cool holidays
              can start rolling in.. anddd i am also hoping to start my yt soon
              as well! i have premire pro (legally) and everything so im excited
              for that as well ^^
            </p>
            <p>
              okay i think thats it for me. so far lifes going.. fine a solid
              7.4/10 but for the world its probably in the negatives ausnjak im
              really just trying to keep my head up as much as i can! as always
              hydrate or die straight, see you all later

              hi its another blog post. who wouldve seen that coming! atp im
              just giving up on doing these consistently, you'll get a blog post
              from be when i feel like it, i guess lol. anyways how have i been?
              um. all over the place really! we've moved again (second move
              documented on my blog) and im working which im not sure if ive
              updated about yet! i work at a ice cream place and its pretty fun,
              if not a bit boring sometimes. us moving though has made it kind
              of a hassle to get there, so im not sure how much longer i can
              keep the job if this keeps on being an issue sadly :( hopefully
              it'll turn out okay tho!
            </p>
            <p>
              ive also been working on some projects of my own. minus doing my
              normal modding things (which ive finally released) ive been trying
              to make a game similar to the one i mod for, which has been pretty
              fun! im not sure if im ever going to release it for multiple
              reasons, but i think its a really good way to learn the engine im
              using more and im learning a lot i think! besides that game
              though, im also working on a lot of character lore and ref sheets
              for artfight this month. hopefully i dont lose motivation too
              early lol
            </p>
            <p>
              now im just rambling BUT i also want to talk about my babies. my
              little guys. my consoles.... i LOVEEEE taking photos on my vita
              and 3ds. the images below are just random food pics from my 3ds, i
              usually take more on my vita but i dont feel like getting those
              files rn haha...
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              idk if you can tell! but i really like food and taking photos of
              food :D i find it fun it still reminds me of places i went with
              people i love just in a different way then photos with their
              faces, yk? anyways.... i took a 3 hour break in between writing
              this so whatever i wanted to say last time i have now forgotten
              LOL so just have some more 3ds screenshots below and i will bid
              you adieu.....

              strongest start to 2025 but its liveable i guess. we&#39;ve been
              kinda struggling really with various stuff but overall i feel like
              im doing... okay. im def living
            </p>
            <p>
              i guess ive been thinking about death a lot? which truthfully im
              not entirely sure why. i mean i <em>know</em> everyones going to
              die and that im going to die someday but i think the prospect of
              not knowing whats after death has been scaring me lately, esp when
              im trying to sleep lol
            </p>
            <p>
              but thats besides the point i dont know why ive been thinking
              about it so much but i had to put the thought out somewhere. just
              saying if i randomly die in my sleep or something please play the
              edgeworth dl-6 theme at my funeral it will be so funny
            </p>
            <p>
              OKAY not talking about all this death lol, making the new site has
              been really fun! its been cool to finally learn how to use
              frameworks and stuff like that to make the site even cooler :D
              honestly im decently happy with how its turning out so far
            </p>
            <p>
              and uhhh... idk ive been watching murder drones which has been
              pretty good, i watched ofmd not too long ago which still makes me
              sad thinking about it, and maybe someday i&#39;ll actually watch
              loki
            </p>
            <p>
              SPEAKING OF LOKI, ive been playing marvel rivals and it bangs ngl,
              its super fun even though i <em>never</em> play sweaty games like
              this (no offense) even though i get comments about how my healing
              sucks every game ;p
            </p>
            <p>
              okay i think im done. honestly so far this month gets a 6/10 not
              bad but certainly not good. maybe it&#39;ll turn around soon
            </p>
            <p>alr im done now goodbye chat hydrate or die straight</p>

            <p>if i'm real, this year low-key kinda sucked.</p>
            <p>
              when it didn't just straight up suck, it was so nothing. i mean i
              didn't do <em>anything</em> that i thought was meaningful— just
              kind of lazed around. which i guess isn't necessarily bad but it
              didn't make me feel very good, you know?
            </p>
            <p>
              i want to change next year. i want to do <em>things</em>, more
              things, even if i'm scared or i fail or it succeeds, i want to
              stop being so scared to do things.
            </p>
            <p>
              i want to be a game developer. i want to be a youtuber. i want to
              be a better artist. i want to have a etsy shop. i want to be proud
              of myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              i did things to try to start that this year, i did a game jam, i
              had a successful youtube short, i did more art studies, i made a
              bunch of stickers. i'm not going to discredit what i did achieve,
              but i feel like i didn't try that much.
            </p>
            <p>
              i look back at what i did this year, and as "proud" as i am now, i
              know i can do better. that i have it in myself to do things that i
              can look back at and smile.
            </p>
            <p>
              not counting the things that happened this year ofc. i moved, he
              left, the 2024 election results, just everything. i'm happy i
              survived, but i would prefer if 2025 wasn't as horrible!
            </p>
            <p>
              i want to be happier, for myself. i want to be a better person. i
              want to be someone my brother can look up to. i want to be a good
              example.
            </p>
            <p><em>i want to be proud.</em></p>
            <p>that's my new year's resolution, i guess.</p>
            <p>
              i hope if you're reading this, you're proud of yourself. if you
              aren't, there's always time to improve. i believe in you.
            </p>
            <p>i love you :)</p>

              okay so. a lot of stuff has happened in the last month for some
              reason. dont know why all of this right now but hey you know life
              has its twists and turns???? first thing is im moving from my
              house we've had for 3 years. typing it out it doesnt seem like
              that long, but the normal time we spend in one house is usually a
              year. maybe a little more, maybe a little less. tbh im not really
              scared of the change? sure its going to be WEIRD, ofc it will, but
              im so used to it im pretty excited. and also kinda not idk how to
              put it
              <br /><br />
              next, i cant tell if ive been improving uh. i guess my daily life?
              bare minimum i now make my bed almost everyday. ive been talking
              to my friends a little more frequently. im still keeping up with
              at least 1 app i downloaded from last month (shoutout finch 2.0).
              anddd im still knee deep in projects. ive been trying to learn
              python, too, so i guess thats an extra bonus. idk in my head i
              feel like im so lazy but techically i am DOING stuff, it just
              doesnt feel like anything. wish i could try to fix that but it
              doesnt seem to go away so sucks to suck. not sure why im ranting
              so much, i mean it is my blog but i hate to be so down, oh well
              <br /><br />
              on a bit of a higher note, next time i blog i'll probably be one
              year older and MAYBE have a "fall" job. as much as im excited for
              it, im also kind of not? i feel so eh to birthdays now but
              celebratings always fun so theres that to look forward to! ive
              also been watching detroit become human which has been pretty
              fun/depressing lol. also appearently some rare blue moon tonight.
              and i think thats all gang wow i really rambled. ok bye

              HII guys im actually in my self care era rn. ive gotten a few apps
              to hopefully maybe try to fix my broken schedule and
              forgetfulness... .hopefully. shoutout to finch because its
              actually really been helping??? i really hope i can stick to it
              this time and it doesnt become abandoned. speaking of abandoned
              we're also bringing duolingo back hi babygirl how i have not
              missed you. but i do want to like try to learn things so its fine!
              haha...
              <br /><br />
              Oh ive also been trying out digital journaling? mostly just making
              little pages its really fun honestly. not much blogging actually
              happens, its mostly just deco, but hey it gives me something fun
              to do :D and ALSO ALSO ive gotten back into genshin sorta, i can
              kinda already feel it dying out but i wont uninstall it yet. i
              still want to try with it lol. uhhh what else... i wanna get my yt
              channel back up soon, i redesigned my mascot and stuff but i wanna
              work on myself a bit first!
              <br /><br />
              ok i think im mostly done. ive just been trying to improve myself
              and my art, and i really hope some of this actually sticks this
              time. i'm going to stay determined and hopefully next post i'll be
              able to say i improved!

              i never know how to start these augh. how do you in fact start a
              post where you just talk about yourself?? no idea but i guess this
              is a way to start it LOL. okay hi i am in project hell but not
              really since im having fun??? does that cancel it out? its fun
              though, ive been drawing a bunch, making a bunch of docs and
              socials, just an overall pretty fun time. im also getting into new
              fandoms which is always fun.
              <br /><br />
              ive actually been trying to expand my fandom range, aka watching
              actual tv shows. i havent like done any of it yet but maybe the
              intentions still there...... i want to watch our flag means death,
              i hear people say its good and as a good omen fan i'll enjoy it
              so. maybe i'll check it out soon. ive also been going back to my
              roots and watching dantdms new series, its crazy how i was just a
              wee little child when i was watching his mod reviews and here i
              am. here he is with children my lord
              <br /><br />
              nothing else crazy to talk about i guess. just been kinda busy
              doing my thing. i think the gmtk jam is coming up soon and
              probably by july i should start trying to find a team- i'll work
              on it when we get there.... but for now im just going to work on
              the things at hand. okay peace out gang

              you guys will eventually learn that i am very, very bad with time.
              anyways, what have i been doing recently? well i feel like i
              should give an update on the dog situation since its been a month!
              he is still here with us and adopted. hes a very silly guy. his
              name is mister amd as of now he is not getting along with our cat,
              but our cat doesnt seem to mind, so at least theres that. lol.
              anyways hes the cutest, i love him so much and ive also been going
              outside a lot more since i have to walk him so yay! grass!
              <br /><br />
              speaking of grass..... minus walking my dog, i have not been
              getting much of it because im too busy playing monster prom hehe.
              once i heard that monster con is coming out i was like "omg this
              is my chance to buy and play all of the monster prom games!" and
              that i did! i now have the full collection and ive been having so
              much fun. i think my favorite game is camp or roadtrip, and i am
              in love with milo. they're so soidfnksd yk??? ok enough of that, i
              might make a shrine for the games soon :]
              <br /><br />
              another thing.... hmmm... well im going on a trip very soon! since
              its my moms birthday, im pretty excited for that. ive also been
              working on improving my art and maybe testing my skills in the
              music realm. one has been going a bit better then the other lol, i
              dont have much of a rhythm apparently. the art thing has been
              going well though! who wouldve thought sitting down and trying to
              learn anatomy would, shockingly, make my art better.
              <br /><br />
              OH and another thing! lego monkie kid s5 soon perhaps! yes,
              looking at the trailer, the animation is a bit stiffer and i am a
              bit sad about that but im too excited about the thought of a new
              lmk trailer so its not that bad. i cant wait to see more nezha and
              red son WOO
              <br /><br />
              okay enough insane rambling for today bye byee
            </p>

              ok so i remembered that mmd existed and that i learned how to use
              it so! ive been making a few things on there :D i actually made a
              few models beforehand for it named scarlet and blue, so ive been
              mostly using them for anything ive been making. i also just
              learned how to animate on there, so maybe i can finally stop using
              other peoples motions and use my own! its super fun, i love just
              looking for new things to experiment with. also seeing all the
              cool stuff people made, its just rly cool overall!
              <br /><br />

              on other news, we're getting the a dog! at least for a month. hes
              a cute little guy. i just hope he doesnt get scared by our cat,
              who at this point, is bigger than him. when im writing this he
              hasnt come home yet, but i hope when he does everything will turn
              out alright!
              <br /><br />
              and last little thing. one thing im very mad about. they removed
              ouran high school host club from netflix. which isnt a crazy
              thing, because you know, netflix changes their catalogue all the
              time, right? but the last time they removed an anime i liked, i
              couldnt watch it ANYWHERE without paying. i mean, it was gone from
              every streaming service. even crunchyroll, funimation. EVERYWHERE.
              and i can only pirate it! i still have but im dissapointed in
              netflix :[ also the anime was k-on for anyone wondering, one of my
              first animes its so cool
              <br /><br />
              i think im done but i hope everyones having a good day, drink
              water, and im peacing out
            </p>

              Hi so this is mostly a test blog just to make sure this works but.
              i might as well rant about something anyways, yk?
              <br /><br />
              ok so coding is so annoying bro. not only do things work only
              sometimes, if they work you try to put it in something and hey! it
              doesnt work anymore! or better yet, you get stuck on this one part
              in your code that just isnt working and you get super upset so you
              walk away, come back and then BOOM it was the most simple thing
              imaginable. i love coding man
              <br /><br />
              anyways in terms of like actual blogging about my life lol, ive
              been pretty good. got a lot of things going on like working on
              this site, maybe making a game, working on a mod, and some other
              things i cant remember lol. ive also been working on my yt channel
              which has been pretty hype! its fun but very tiring to constantly
              work on videos, idk how these big yters do it honestly.
              <br /><br />
              ok i think im going to shut up now BUT im pretty happy rn and my
              life isnt sucking so YEAH :]
