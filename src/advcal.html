        <li><h3>december 2st : 'youtube declutter' | luigi mansion</h3></li>
        <p>
          the youtube declutter genuinely took like an hour and a half. having a
          gacha phase really screwed me over i guess LOL + ive had this yt for 6
          years so a lot of random subs. but otherwise its nice and clean now!
          yippee
        </p>
        <p>
          and for the game, i tried luigi's mansion but i didnt get very far at
          all LOL i might just be bad at the game.... its also a little too dark
          for me (like visually. its a weird thing don't mind me) so i got bored
          quick .... I'LL REVISIT LATER I THINK i just dont think today was the
          day for it haha

          and for game, i played harvest moon: the tale of two towns! it was
          really fun honestly, as someone who is very normal about stardew
          valley, it kinda felt like a mini og verison of it which was super
          cool! i ended up picking bluebell for my town, and i'll probably
          continue playing it and give a review later :D great introduction
          though!
