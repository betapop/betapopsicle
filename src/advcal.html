        <li><h3>december 16th : update! | ace attorney</h3></li>
        <p>
          HI IM BACK! and funnily enough, a lot of the new advent prompts ive
          already done sometime this month or even before! so heres my update
          for those :3
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: var(--font-link)">
          december 12th : 'browser switch'
        </h4>
        <p>
          ive actually switched my browser a few times! im currently using
          <a href="https://zen-browser.app/" target="_blank">zen</a> (which is
          awesome btw) and i also moved to
          <a href="https://www.startpage.com/" target="_blank">startpage</a> as
          well! if you guys have any other mobile browser recs tho lmk.....
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: var(--font-link)">december 10th : 'passwords'</h4>
        <p>
          i just changed my passwords yesterday! i have not been very safe with
          my passwords honestly, esp having such old accounts... now they are
          safer! a bunch of 2fas as well. hopefully i wont get #hacked anytime
          soon
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: var(--font-link)">december 7th : 'anti-stalker'</h4>
        <p>
          this one kinda shocked me honestly. i have nothing that shows up about
          me when i google myself as far as im concerned which is great! i
          remember i had like one thing when i was younger but i had deleted it
          so yay. online privacy for the win
        </p>
        <h4 style="color: var(--font-link)">
          december 15th : 'that's a wrap on spotify'
        </h4>
        <p>
          THIS ONE IM THE MOST EXCITED TO SHARE... honestly ive been tired of
          spotify for a while (hence my use of spicetify) and ive been streaming
          a bunch of music on my phone through vlc. AND NOW it is all on vlc
          between my pc and phone! plus with last fm i can still track how much
          i listen, plus i can still have it show on my discord :3
        </p>
        <p>
          and if you know me or look at this site at all its probably very
          apparent i am an ace attorney fan... so why is it here? ummm uhhh its
          my challenge BUT ALSO i replayed a case that i havent in a while
          (turnabout storyteller) and it was so peak so uhh yeah play ace
          attorney pls
        </p>
        <li><h3>december 3rd : ...?</h3></li>
        <p>
          no update for now! too busy working on the
          <a href="./deltarune.html">deltarune</a> page, lol
        </p>
        <li><h3>december 2st : 'youtube declutter' | luigi mansion</h3></li>
        <p>
          the youtube declutter genuinely took like an hour and a half. having a
          gacha phase really screwed me over i guess LOL + ive had this yt for 6
          years so a lot of random subs. but otherwise its nice and clean now!
          yippee
        </p>
        <p>
          and for the game, i tried luigi's mansion but i didnt get very far at
          all LOL i might just be bad at the game.... its also a little too dark
          for me (like visually. its a weird thing don't mind me) so i got bored
          quick .... I'LL REVISIT LATER I THINK i just dont think today was the
          day for it haha

          and for game, i played harvest moon: the tale of two towns! it was
          really fun honestly, as someone who is very normal about stardew
          valley, it kinda felt like a mini og verison of it which was super
          cool! i ended up picking bluebell for my town, and i'll probably
          continue playing it and give a review later :D great introduction
          though!
